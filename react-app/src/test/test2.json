        "slide_text": "Ionic bonds are a type of chemical bond that forms between two atoms or ions with opposite charges. It occurs when one atom donates an electron to another atom, resulting in the formation of positively and negatively charged ions. These ions are then attracted to each other, effectively creating a bond.\n\nIonic bonds typically occur between a metal and a non-metal. Metals have a tendency to lose electrons and form positively charged ions called cations, while non-metals have a tendency to gain electrons and form negatively charged ions called anions. This transfer of electrons creates the electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged ions.\n\nFor example, let's consider sodium chloride (NaCl). Sodium (Na) has one valence electron and chlorine (Cl) has seven valence electrons. Sodium donates its one valence electron to chlorine, resulting in the formation of Na+ and Cl- ions. The positive sodium ion and the negative chloride ion are then strongly attracted to each other, forming an ionic bond.\n\nIonic bonds are strong and have high melting and boiling points due to the strong electrostatic attraction between the ions. They also tend to form crystalline structures, which are organized and repetitive arrangements of ions. These structures give ionic compounds their characteristic properties, such as being brittle and having the ability to conduct electricity when dissolved in water.\n\nIn summary, ionic bonds are formed when electrons are transferred between atoms, resulting in the formation of oppositely charged ions. These ions are attracted to each other due to their opposite charges, forming a strong bond. Ionic compounds have unique properties and are commonly found in nature as salts and minerals."
