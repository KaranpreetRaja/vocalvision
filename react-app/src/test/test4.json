      "slide_text": "The common cold is a viral infection that affects the upper respiratory system. It is a highly contagious illness that is caused primarily by rhinoviruses. Rhinoviruses are a group of more than 100 different types of viruses that can infect and replicate in the nose and throat. These viruses are spread through droplets in the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or by coming into contact with surfaces contaminated with the virus. "

      "slide_text": "\n\nWhen a person breathes in or touches a contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth, the virus can enter their body. Once inside, the virus attaches to the cells lining the nasal passages and throat, and begins to replicate, leading to the symptoms of the common cold such as sneezing, coughing, sore throat, congestion, and runny nose.

      "slide_text": "\n\nThe common cold is more prevalent during the colder months, hence the name \"cold.\" This may be due to the fact that people tend to spend more time indoors in close proximity to others, providing better opportunities for the virus to spread. Additionally, colder temperatures and lower humidity levels may weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to viral infections. Overall, the common cold is caused by viral infections, primarily rhinoviruses, that are easily transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces. "
